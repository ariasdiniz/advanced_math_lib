# libamath - Advanced Math Library

**libamath** is a C library that provides advanced mathematical functions, with a focus on algorithms for statistical analysis and genetic algorithms. The library is optimized for performance, with multithreaded implementations for various distributions and transforms, making it suitable for computationally intensive tasks.

## Features

Currently, libamath includes the following functionalities:

### Genetic Algorithms
- **Individuals generation**: Create a population of individuals, each with a set of weights. Includes mutation and reproduction mechanisms.
- **Reproduction**: Replaces low-fitness individuals by reproducing the best-performing individuals, using the mean of their weights.
- **Mutation**: Randomly alters the weights of individuals based on a mutation probability.
- **Fitness evaluation**: A user-defined function to evaluate the fitness of each individual in the population.

### Statistical Functions
- **Mean**: Calculate the mean of a dataset.
- **Median**: Compute the median of a dataset, with an option to pre-sort the data.
- **Standard Deviation**: Compute the standard deviation of a dataset.

### Kendall Correlation
- **Kendall's Tau**: Calculate the Kendall rank correlation coefficient between two datasets.

### Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)
- **DFT**: Perform a Discrete Fourier Transform on a dataset, with multithreading support for faster execution.
- **Inverse DFT**: Perform an inverse DFT to revert transformed data back to the time domain.

### Normal and Poisson Distributions
- **Normal Distribution**: Calculate the normal distribution of a dataset, optimized with multithreading.
- **Poisson Distribution**: Compute the Poisson distribution of a dataset, also supporting multithreading.

## Future Work

In the future, **libamath** will be extended with additional features, including:

- **Variance Calculation**: Useful alongside the standard deviation.
- **Covariance**: For measuring how two datasets vary together.
- **Linear Regression**: For modeling relationships between variables.
- **Binomial Distribution**: To complement the Poisson distribution.
- **Gamma Distribution**: Another probability distribution that could be useful in various applications.
- **Including more functions to the CLI tool**

## Installation

To use libamath, simply clone this repository and include the source files in your project. The library is licensed under the MIT license, so you are free to use, modify, and distribute it in your own projects. When using `libamath` don't forget to link `-lamath -lm` during compilation.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ariasdiniz/advanced_math_lib.git
```

If you want to install it in your UNIX system you can use the `install.sh` script. It needs superuser access and GCC compiler instaled.

If you have Make installed, you can also build with

```shell
make
```

This way you will build the lib's Shared Object and also an executable called `amath`. This executable is a simple command line tool
to run functions like `stdev`, `mean`, `ndist` and `median` in a stream of data read from STDIN.

## Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the genetic algorithm functionality in libamath:

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <time.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <amath.h>

/*
  This code aims to demonstrate the functioning of the genetic algorithm.

  For this, we have the following problem:

  We have a basket that can carry 8 kg, and we have a set of 4 products.
  Their weights are 3 kg, 4 kg, 5kg and 8 kg, represented by the algorithm's
  weights 0, 1, 2 and 3 respectively.

  The problem is to determine the number of unique products
  this basket can carry. The response is 2 items, one that wights 3 kg
  and another that weights 5 kg. Or it could be only the item with 8 kg.

  For this problem, the best fitted individuals of the algorithm
  have to have, after training, weights like:

  0 => between 0.2 and 1
  1 => approximately 0
  2 => between 0.2 and 1
  3 => approximately 0

  OR

  0 => approximately 0
  1 => approximately 0
  2 => approximately 0
  3 => between 0.2 and 1

  For better results, increase the number of individuals and the
  number of iterations, at the cost of greater computing time.

void *fun(Individuals *individuals) {
  double result = 0;
  int array_size = individuals->n_individuals;
  Individual **individual = individuals->individual_array;
  for (int i = 0; i < array_size; i++) {
    if (individual[i]->weights[0] >= 0.01) result += 3;
    if (individual[i]->weights[1] >= 0.01) result += 4;
    if (individual[i]->weights[2] >= 0.01) result += 5;
    if (individual[i]->weights[3] >= 0.01) result += 8;
    if (result > 8 || result <= 0 ) {
      individual[i]->fitness = 0.0;
      result = 0;
      continue;
    }
    individual[i]->fitness = result;
    result = 0;
  }
  return NULL;
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  srand(time(NULL));
  Individuals *individuals = generate_individuals(100000, 0.05, 0.0001, 0.25, 4, 0.0, 1.0);
  for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
    fit(individuals, fun);
    mutate(individuals);
    reproduce(individuals);
  }
  printf("Individual 1, weight 0 : %f\n", individuals->individual_array[0]->weights[0]);
  printf("Individual 1, weight 1 : %f\n", individuals->individual_array[0]->weights[1]);
  printf("Individual 1, weight 2 : %f\n", individuals->individual_array[0]->weights[2]);
  printf("Individual 1, weight 3 : %f\n", individuals->individual_array[0]->weights[3]);
  destroy_individuals(individuals);
  return 0;
}
```

## CLI Usage

If you want to use the CLI to transform data from the comfort of your terminal, you can build this project using `make`.
After that, add the executable to your path. The executable need a positional argument to work, alog with a data stream
through STDIN. The data should be only numbers separated by a line break character.

Example, if you have a file called `data.txt` with only a column of numbers as content, and you want to calculate it's median,
you can 

```shell
cat data.txt | amath median
```

The supported arguments are
    - median
    - mean
    - ndist
    - stdev

You can also call
```shell
amath --help
```

for more info. In the future I plan to add more functions to this CLI.
